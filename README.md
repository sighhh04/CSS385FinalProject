"A cross between a 2D platformer and a 2D shooter where the primary goal is to navigate through a level, 
killing enemies along the way with different abilities, then fight a boss at the end"

3 similar games:
- Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Mega Man

"Similar to Cuphead with the different shooting abilities, similar to Hollow Knight with platforming and melee combat,
and similar to Mega Man in level design, but takes place in a medieval setting where you can collet armour, swords, 
shields, spears, axes, and bows"
